Following is a detailed description of the Beta Bid System:

- When the program is first run, it goes to the main page, which includes:
-	The title
-	The Quality Excavation logo
  - Three tabs (as of right now):
    - Save Page
    - Data Search Page
    - Calculation Page (to be completed)

- Save Page:
•	For testing purposes, the Save Page is connected to a tester table on the SQL Analysis Database.
•	The following can be entered:
•	Bid Item (a number)
•	Description
•	Units
•	Bid Quality
•	Unit Price
  - Each area Beside the named label is a text box that accepts input.
  - At the bottom, there are three buttons:
    - Clear Button(Clears out the information that was inputted)
    - Add to Database Button
    - Back Button (takes you back to the main page)

-	Database Search Page:
•	Shows search criteria, which can be:
•	City/Town/County
•	Bid Item Number
•	Job Name
•	Description
•	The page includes:
•	Search Button
•	Clear Button (clears the inputted search)
•	Back Button (goes back to the main page)
•	The current Data View Grid Box shows the table of bid items from 2023 bid tabs, created by joining multiple tables into one large table.

•	City and Town Section:
•	Combo boxes are connected.
•	When you click the selected city from the drop-down list, it shows you what counties that city resides in (since multiple cities in Texas can reside in multiple counties).

- Search Function:
•	Currently works for searching just one table.
•	The overall goal is to search the whole database without having to combine everything within a large table.
•	Further process can be done, if needed, to make a dynamic table that automates the process of combining tables into one larger table for future work.
